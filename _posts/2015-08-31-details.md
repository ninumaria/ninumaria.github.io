 <h2>Harry Potter - Chapter 17</h2>
 <p> 
 Listened to audio of Harry Potter chapter 17.
 Read and recoreded my reading.

  <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
  <p>
  Tried solving probles from c4 learn site.
  Came across an issue while solving factorial program.
  The issue is due to the usage of pow function.
  The issue is occuring during compiling because of not 
  linking math library while compiling.
  Once i linked the program started working.
