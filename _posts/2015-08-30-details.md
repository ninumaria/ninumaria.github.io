 <h2>Food preparation for the day</h2>
 <p> 
 I had prepared parripu curry.It was one among my best parippu curry i ever prepared.
 Still,the drumsticks got overcooked.
 Then i made kovaka thoran,it was pretty much okay okay and simple curry to prepare.
 Then i made rice which was the important and most simple food to prepare.
 Lunch was pretty good and i got appreciation too from my loving Husband.
 We had the same for both lunch and dinner.

 <h2>Game Development</h2>
 <p>
 Started preparing game using various components like ball,slider,label bricks and all.
 As per the concept of divide and conquer method i tried making a program using the 
 combination of slider and label.
 Another program which makes the ball to hit four edges of the wall.
 Made a third program to move the ball from one corner to another diagonally and edge to edge.
