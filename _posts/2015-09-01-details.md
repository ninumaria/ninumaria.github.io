 <h2>Program Solving</h2>
 <p> 
 Solved problems from C4learn mostly involving arrays.
 Came across an issue while solving whether the number is 
 pallindrome or not.
 1.The issue occurs while compiling.So i discussed the scenario 
 with the husdand,we came into a conclusion that the strrev
 function used in the problem is not defined in string library.
 So i defined the function in the program as an userdefined function.
 After that the program start compiling and run smoothly.
 2.One more issue occured while solving delete the duplicate 
 element in an array.So i started analysing the code,then 
 it seems to be understandable.

 <h2>Cooking Experience</h2>
 <p>
 I prepared vallarika pullissery.
 I cant say it was a disaster,but it became very liquidy
 and the cocunut was not grounded properly.
 So the curry was just okay okay only.
 But,i understood the problems i made so hope i 
 can make up for that in my next attempts.
