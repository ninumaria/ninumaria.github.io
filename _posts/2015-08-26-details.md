 <h2>Cut the sticks</h2>
 <p>
 Came across lot of possible solutions for solving the problem.
 Stuck with an issue of finding the smallest among the array.
 The output of the  program turns into an infinite loop.
 </p>
 
 <h2>ChoclateFeast</h2>
 <p>
 The problem is all about finding the number of choclated obtained by giving money and wrappers back.
 It was a quiet interesting problem ,but came across an issue in infinite output due to improper looping for 
 wrapper return for chocolate.
