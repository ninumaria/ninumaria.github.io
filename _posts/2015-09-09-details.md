 <h2>Vectors and Scalars</h2>
 <p> 
 Magnitude is the distance moved by the object.
 If an object moves particular distance the distance travelled by the
 object is defined as the distance.
 If an object moves particular distance with directin the distance travelled by the
 object with direction is defined as the displacement.
 Speed of the object is calculated by the distance travelled
 by the time taken to travel the distance.
 
 	speed = distance / time.

 Velocity of the object is calculated by the displacement travelled
 by the time taken to travel the displacement.
 
 	velocity = displacement / time.
 	
 Any motion or movement which is having direction is called a Vector quantity.
 Any motion or movement without any direction is called a Scalar quantity.
